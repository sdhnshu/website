Hey there! I'm a tech entrepreneur deeply rooted in the world of software development, with a journey that's been anything but ordinary.

I've dived into the depths and surfaced with skills that have helped me kickstart and grow SaaS startups. My playground is deep learning models and data science – it’s where I get my hands dirty and my brain buzzing with ideas.

Curious about what I've been up to? Take a peek at my [blog](/blog) and [creations](/creations)

Now, let's dive into the fun stuff! Stepping away from the keyboard, you'll find me immersed in the world of generative art, cellular automata, and creating simulations that mimic the complexities of life and nature. I'm equally fascinated by graph networks, exploring the interconnectedness of systems and ideas. Neuroscience also captivates me deeply – it's a field I can’t rave about enough, given its insights into our minds and behaviors.

And when it's time to unwind? Music is my go-to. I'm such a music buff that I've consistently landed in the top 1% of Spotify users for several years – a testament to the countless hours I spend exploring diverse melodies and rhythms.

If you're into blending art, science, tech, with a good beat, or just want to exchange thoughts on the universe's wild complexities, let’s strike up a conversation. I’m always up for sharing ideas, creating something new, or simply enjoying the marvels of our world and its tunes.
